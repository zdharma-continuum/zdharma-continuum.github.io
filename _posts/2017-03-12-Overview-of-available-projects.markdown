I've developed 14 Zsh projects. I see five of them to be at Zdharma
mainstream, rest of the projects might get an uplift to fit into Zdharma goals
(robust and well working Zsh software) in the future, mainly by use of ZUI
curses interface library. <!-- more --> One of the projects is a Zsh module, not a plugin:

* [ZUI](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zui) –
  CGI+(D)HTML-like RAD user interface library (curses)
* [Zconvey](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zconvey) –
  send commands to other Zsh processes
* [history-search-multi-word](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/history-search-multi-word) –
  multi-term history searching for Zsh
* [Zinit](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit) –
  plugin manager with clean fpath and reports
* [zgdbm](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zgdbm) –
  rewritten GDBM module, posted to upstream, further developed at Zdharma

Remaining good, but not yet revisited and uplifted plugins:
* [Zsh Navigation Tools](https://github.com/psprint/zsh-navigation-tools) –
  curses-based tools, e.g. multi-word history searcher
* [Zsh Editing Workbench](https://github.com/psprint/zsh-editing-workbench) –
  sane, sophisticated command line editing
* [zsh-morpho](https://github.com/psprint/zsh-morpho) –
  terminal screen savers written in pure Zsh
* [Zsh Command Architect](https://github.com/psprint/zsh-cmd-architect) –
  build commands from what's in history and at prompt
* [Ztrace](https://github.com/psprint/ztrace) –
  record output of commands, reuse it via curses interface
* [Zsnapshot](https://github.com/psprint/zsnapshot) –
  zsh session restoration
* [zsh-select](https://github.com/psprint/zsh-select) –
  selection list written in pure Zsh
* [zprompts](https://github.com/psprint/zprompts) –
  independent themes for Zsh
* [zzcomplete](https://github.com/psprint/zzcomplete) –
