When writing Zsh plugins I learned (i.a. thanks to #zsh channel) how to avoid
forks to external tools, for speed and lack of dependencies. I've put this
experience into Asciidoc document.<!-- more --> It captures essential differences between
Bash and Zsh and provides quick introduction to Zshell main features, like
extended-glob or in-substitution code execution. There are two versions
of the document (rendered differently):
